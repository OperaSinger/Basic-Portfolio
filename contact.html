            <p>Having spent my career on the stage and in the pratice-room as an opera singer, you can safely say that this new career path is new to me. Programming has always been in my blood and This summer, I am taking a transfusion of code while studying at Rutgers in their <a href="https://bootcamp.rutgers.edu/" target=0>Computer Science Bootcamp</a></p>
            <p>I live in the Allentown area with my wife and two children, enjoy bicycling (and of course music), and am dedicated to filling your need with someone who can create, maintain or problem-solve your web applications - from databases using jQuery, funcionality using Javascript, or with HTML and photo-editing to solve the presentation of your business to the world over the internet.</p>
